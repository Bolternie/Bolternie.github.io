<!-- **Summer Internship**:Currently,I am gaining practical experience in power electronics through the design of a **22kW LLC converter**. In this role, I am responsible for the complete design process, from creating the resonant tank in Simulink and conducting power loss calculations to optimizing magnetic components. I have also designed a 4-layer PCB using Altium Designer that complies with IEC 61000-4-5 surge standards, and I am currently focused on the final implementation stages of DSP programming and prototype debugging. -->

**Independent research** ｜ Development of LLC control strategy <br>
• Developed a simplified time-domain model with high accuracy<br>
• Developed a feedforward control strategy with fast control and wide output range <br>
• Achieved 4.78% error in the proposed model vs. 22.37% error of state-of-the-art<br>
• Achieved 10x faster control speed in the above-resonance region<br><br>

**Project Leader**: I led a **National college student innovation and entrepreneurship project** that focuses on the intelligent recognition and detection of PT and arrester temperatures in substations using OrangePi AIpro, where I am applying advanced AI techniques to enhance operational efficiency.

**Project Leader**: As a project leader in my junior year, I led a project focused on intelligent video monitoring of traffic targets using the Huawei Atlas 200DK board, which involved both coordination and technical execution.





### Sophomore Year

**Research Training**: During my freshman year, I conducted research at **the State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment**, where I prepared pure epoxy resin and measured space charge using the pulsed electro-acoustic method. Additionally, I investigated the influence of biaxially oriented polypropylene film processing factors on energy storage characteristics.
